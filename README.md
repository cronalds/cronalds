- 👋 Hi, I’m @cronalds
- 👀 I’m interested in programming things, and I generally end up jerry rigging, breaking, fixing, and refining systems because I just can't help myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development; currently hold certificate IV but I'm halfway through my diploma.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mainly tools and systems; but only for money, to be honest; I'll just work on my own stuff for free.
- 📫 How to reach me: astrangerman95@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am disdainfully poor but wish to be as rich as Scrooge McDuck; if I don't have a money bin by 2030 then I may as well not bother.
